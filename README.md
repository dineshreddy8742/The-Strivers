AI-Driven Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Tool for Advancing Circularity and Sustainability in Metallurgy and Mining
🔹 Description
Background

As industries increasingly emphasize sustainability, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is emerging not just as a tool for measuring environmental impact, but as a key strategy for advancing circularity. Metals such as aluminium, copper, and critical minerals—vital to sectors from energy to infrastructure—undergo multiple stages: from extraction and processing to use and end-of-life. Traditional linear models often result in resource depletion and waste.

Modern LCA frameworks now assess not only emissions and resource use, but also the potential for reuse, recycling, and closed-loop systems. By informing decisions on product design, manufacturing, and end-of-life recovery, LCA enables a shift toward a circular economy where materials are kept in use longer and waste is minimized.

Problem Statement

There is a need for an intuitive, AI-powered software platform that allows metallurgists, engineers, and decision-makers to perform automated LCAs for metals (aluminium, copper, critical minerals), with a focus on circularity and sustainable resource use.

Proposed Solution

The platform is designed to:

Allow users to input or select process and production details, including:

Raw vs. recycled material routes

Energy use

Transport and logistics

End-of-life scenarios

Use AI/ML models to:

Estimate missing parameters

Predict environmental and circularity indicators, such as recycled content, resource efficiency, extended product life, and potential for reuse

Provide visualizations of:

Circular flow opportunities

Environmental impacts across the full value chain (from extraction to recycling/reuse)

Enable easy comparison of conventional vs. circular processing pathways

Generate actionable reports and recommendations for reducing impacts and enhancing circularity, even when user data is limited.

Impact

With this tool, the metals sector will be empowered to make practical, data-driven choices that:

Foster environmental sustainability

Promote circular, resource-efficient systems

Reduce waste and extend material lifetimes

Support decision-making for product design, processing, and end-of-life management
