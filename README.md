# 🌿 AI-Driven Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Tool for Advancing Circularity and Sustainability in Metallurgy and Mining

**Team:** The Strivers

**Problem Statement ID:** SIH25069

---

## 🔹 Overview

As industries increasingly emphasize sustainability, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is evolving beyond an environmental measurement tool into a key strategy for advancing circularity. Metals such as aluminium, copper, and critical minerals—vital to sectors from energy to infrastructure—undergo multiple stages: extraction, processing, use, and end-of-life. Traditional linear models often lead to resource depletion and waste.

Our platform leverages **AI and ML** to automate LCA processes, providing actionable insights into environmental and circularity performance while promoting resource-efficient, circular systems.

---

## 🔹 Problem Statement

Current LCA tools are either too generic or require extensive expertise, limiting their practical adoption in metallurgy and mining. There is a need for an **intuitive, AI-powered platform** that allows metallurgists, engineers, and decision-makers to:

* Perform automated LCAs for metals (aluminium, copper, critical minerals)
* Focus on circularity and sustainable resource use
* Access actionable insights even with limited data

---

## 🔹 Proposed Solution

The platform is designed to:

1. **Input & Selection:**
   Users can input or select production process details, including:

   * Raw vs. recycled material routes
   * Energy consumption
   * Transport and logistics
   * End-of-life scenarios

2. **AI/ML Predictions:**

   * Estimate missing environmental and circularity parameters
   * Predict indicators such as recycled content, resource efficiency, extended product life, and potential for reuse

3. **Visualizations:**

   * Circular flow opportunities
   * Environmental impacts across the full value chain
   * Comparative dashboards for conventional vs. circular processing pathways

4. **Automated Reports:**

   * Generate actionable recommendations to reduce impacts and enhance circularity

5. **Scenario Comparison:**

   * Easily compare conventional and circular production pathways

---

## 🔹 Impact

By adopting this tool, the metals sector can:

* Foster environmental sustainability
* Promote circular, resource-efficient systems
* Reduce waste and extend material lifetimes
* Support data-driven decision-making in product design, processing, and end-of-life management
